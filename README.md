# DPLL-WalkSAT
Implementation of the WalkSAT and DPLL algorithms, designed for the AI class which I attended in University.

## Compilation
The main program is the bcsp-mod.c. The math libary is used so it needs to be compiled as follows:
`gcc bcsp-mod.c -lm -o <out-name>`
so that it can be linked into the binary.
